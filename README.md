# LCL Programming Language Developed by Luis F. Ruelas and Eduardo Nieves for the ICOM4036 Course Project

# Introduction
The Logical Circuits Language, or LCL for short, is a simple programming language that allows a user to simulate a logical circuit with a few lines of code which are parsed into a Java intermediate code. After the successful compilation and execution of LCL intermediate code the user will be presented with their circuit in a GUI that allows them to see the result of their circuit simulation as well as edit the current circuit in real time to simulate other logical circuits by following the LCL code syntax.

## Why use LCL?
Sometimes you want to simulate a simple logical circuit and you don’t want to learn how to use software tools or simulators to accomplish a simple simulation of your logical circuit. You also don’t want to have to learn to use programming languages like C, C++, C#, Python, etc., so that you can make your own simple simulation of a logical circuit. This is where LCL comes into play by writing simple grammatical expressions LCL provides a bridge between the simple and the complex. It provides a GUI, driven by Java, that is simple and allows you to edit your logical circuit in real-time by using its simple grammatical expressions.

## Language Features
* Translate LCL’s simple grammar into complex Java code that can be compiled and run.
* Create a GUI that presents your logical circuits and simulates them and allows for  real-time editing of those circuits.
